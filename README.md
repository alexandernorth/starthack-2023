## Description

*EcoClimb - Our Sustainability Awareness App*

Our app is built on the concept of gamification, which uses gaming elements to increase employee engagement and motivation. With stunning graphics, exciting challenges, and interactive features, our app will teach employees about the company's sustainability goals and initiatives in a fun and immersive way. Employees can earn in-game points by completing sustainability missions and challenges, such as reducing waste or conserving energy in the workplace. But it doesn't stop there - we are excited to offer employees the opportunity to win exciting prizes by earning the most in-game points!

Through the use of our app, employees will not only learn about sustainability but also be motivated to adopt more sustainable habits in their daily lives. Our app provides a platform for friendly competition among colleagues, with the chance to win rewards for sustainable behavior both inside and outside of work. This can lead to a more significant impact on the environment beyond the workplace, contributing to a more sustainable future for all. Our app is designed to foster a culture of sustainability awareness and action among your employees, which can lead to more significant changes in your business's overall sustainability practices.

With state of the art technologies such as ReactJs for frontend and Go-Gin for REST API Integration we created a beautiful app that allows employees to making an impact a fun interaction. Using live data aggregated from factory data sources (provided by the Bell Food Group) we can give insightful information and trends on current consumption behaviors.
